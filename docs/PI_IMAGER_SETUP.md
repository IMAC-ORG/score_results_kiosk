ssh resultskiosk@aerojudge.local
# Password: ScoreKiosk#2025
```

If SSH connects successfully, your Pi is ready for kiosk installation!

## Troubleshooting

**Can't find "Raspberry Pi OS (Legacy, 32-bit)"?**
- Make sure you have the latest version of Raspberry Pi Imager
- Look for the version that says "Bookworm" and "32-bit"
- It may be under "Raspberry Pi OS (other)" "Raspberry Pi OS (Legacy, 32-bit)"

**Pi won't connect to WiFi?**
- Double-check SSID and password are exact (case-sensitive)
- Make sure your AeroJudge WiFi network is active
- Try connecting manually from the Pi desktop first

**Can't SSH to the Pi?**
- Wait a full 3 minutes after first boot
- Try `ssh resultskiosk@192.168.8.XXX` if .local doesn't work
- Check your router to find the Pi's IP address
- Make sure you're on the same network as the Pi
